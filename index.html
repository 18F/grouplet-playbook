<p>Grouplets are teams of volunteers that address concerns affecting a
broad segment of the organization. 18F currently has two types of grouplets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://goo.gl/ErlXCc">Working groups</a>: Leaders are emergent from the group. Working groups often have no authority 
  and few, if any, direct resources. It's incumbent upon them to recruit volunteers and make the best use of their time.</li>
  <li><a href="guilds/">Guilds</a>: Leaders are established by the 18F leadership team. Guilds often have a specific authorities and objectives as well as a dedicated staff.</li>
</ul>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li>Maintaining team cohesion over time</li>
<li>Understanding the various forces at play in an organization</li>
<li>Making the undertaking high-impact and fun</li>
</ul>

<p>Mike's (very) long-form article <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/testing-culture.html#culture-change"><em>Goto
Fail, Heartbleed, and Unit Testing Culture</em></a> contains many more details
and examples regarding the Google Testing Grouplet's effort to drive adoption
of automated testing. His hour-long talk

Scale Development Culture Change: Google and the U.S. Government</a> is an
attempt to relate many of these experiences to the effort to improve digital service practices in government.</p>

A **working group** is an ad hoc group that spins up or down depending on
current needs to solve a problem, work through a question, or collectively
think on something.

## Birth process for working groups
* Anyone in 18F can launch a working group at any time.  
* We recommended asking for feedback in #general, #teamops, #wg-working_groups, or a related Slack channel before forming a working group.
* The minimum components for a working group are a Slack channel (starting with 'wg-') and a GitHub repo for notes and collaboration.  
* Identify a mission, objectives, and projects. 
* Weigh quantitative or qualitative measurements.  
* Most working groups have one or two leaders. That said, some working groups
may be a way for multiple related teams to have open channels of communication,
such as #wg-training, which provides a place for various training initiatives
to report on progress, for individuals to ask for help, and for interested experts
to give feedback on training initiatives.
* Each working group should post a general description of the group's purpose in their Slack channel description and set one or more initial goals. Goals can be added or updated at any time and removed when done or it's decided that they're no longer goals.

Memorialize the following information in the [working groups folder](https://github.com/18F/data-private/tree/master/working_groups):  
* Leads  
* Mission  
* Quantitative or qualitative measurements and key results   
* Projects  
* Status  
* Slack channel

## Pausing working groups 
* When a working group no longer has objectives or isn't regularly meeting or using their Slack channel, any member can propose pausing the working group's efforts.
* If there's no renewal in activity and no strong resistance to a proposed hiatus, the working group should change its status to "paused." Do this by changing the working group's status from "active" to "paused" in the [working groups folder](https://github.com/18F/data-private/tree/master/working_groups), and by requesting in #slack-admins that the group's Slack channel be archived.  

## Re-activating a working group
* Anyone can join a paused working group and reactivate it if they feel that new objectives and sufficient interest exist from the team to pursue them.  
* Reactivate a group by requesting the reactivation of the working group's Slack channel in #slack-admins and changing the working group's status from "paused" to "active" in the [working groups folder](https://github.com/18F/data-private/tree/master/working_groups).

A **guild** formally recognizes a strong need by 18F for a specific skill set that benefits from additional attention and leadership.

A guild is a cross-functional, horizontal team. Most people self-select as members of the guild, but a guild may require project teams identify a guild liaison or augment their team with a guild member to support the team or, sometimes, ensure compliance with legal requirements or established practices.

Each guild must draft a charter with goals and measures to which they hold each other accountable. The charter may include [objectives and milestones they are working toward]({{site.baseurl}}/processes-and-artifacts/#okrs).  Guild leads are accountable for hitting milestones and making progress toward goals, including taking steps to measure progress. The guild may establish requirements for project teams. Those requirements must clearly contribute to project success or legal requirements, and the guild must support the project team in meeting those requirements.

Guild leaders have a responsibility to make sure we are strong in the guild's area of expertise. If we are, the guild can provide passive resources and be responsible for periodic evaluation or other measures to monitor the strength of the team. If needed, guild leaders must carve out enough time to ensure the guild provides appropriate resources for the team, which may involve requesting additional people to devote dedicated time for specific projects or activities that are needed to support the work of the guild.

## <a name="formation"></a>Formation

Guilds come into existence one of two ways: Leadership can request that a team member lead a particular guild or a self-organized [working group]({{site.baseurl}}/working-groups) can petition leadership to acquire guild status.

Anyone may become a guild member at any time, but guild leaders are appointed based on their demonstrated ability with the guild area of focus and their experience inside and outside 18F.

If you think a working group has reached a point at which it should become a guild, [email the senior leadership team](mailto:18f-supervisors@gsa.gov) with a short explanation why, as well as who you think would be a good choice of guild leader(s). The senior leadership team will review the working groupâ€™s work and make a formal announcement if the guild is created.

## <a name="sponsorship-and-accountability"></a>Sponsorship and accountability

All guilds will have a sponsor on the leadership team. The sponsor is not responsible for setting the objectives for a guild, but the sponsor will check in to ensure a guild is holding itself accountable to its goals.

Guild sponsors convene once each quarter to evaluate guild progress. Based on the outcome of this meeting, the sponsor may recommend spinning down a guild or revoking sponsorship altogether. If a guild has its sponsorship revoked, its charter may need to be revised to remove project team requirements and it may lose dedicated resources; however, it may continue to operate as a working group.

Sponsorship allows guilds to have a more formal voice in organizational decision-making. Collaboration with the guild sponsor allows guild leaders to align their objectives with 18F organizational priorities.

Guild responsibilities include:

* Establish a charter.
* Develop [standards and/or best practices](https://pages.18.gov/guides/) for work pertaining to the guild's domain.
* Help others outside the guild gain experience and understanding of the guild's domain.
* Develop measurable outcomes.
* As needed, define and work toward [milestones, artifacts, and deliverables]({{site.baseurl}}/processes-and-artifacts/#okrs).
* Provide a model that will set a baseline and standards for the entire organization.
* Create a way to validate how projects are doing with regard to the guild area of expertise that provides a clear benefit to the project while minimizing disruption.

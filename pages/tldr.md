## Birth Process for Working Groups 
* Anyone on the 18F can launch a working group at any time.  
* It is recommended to first ask for feedback on the idea in #general, #teamops, #wg-working_groups, or a related channel in the 18F Slack.  
* The minimum components for a working group are a slack channel (starting with 'wg-') and a google document for notes and collaboration.  
* Identify a mission, objectives, and projects.  
* Weigh quantifiable or qualitative measurements.  
* At any one point, there should be at least one (ideally two) organizers.   
* Each working group should post a general description of the group's purpose in the slack channel description and set 1 or more initial goals.  Goals can be added or updated at any time and removed with done or it is decided that they are no longer goals.
